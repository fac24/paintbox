# ✨ Introduction

- An app that brings up the spirits of anyone and everyone that feels down and concerned with troubles. This app also gives users a journal to express and track their art privately.
- This comes down to art therapy- users can upload art that reflects their mood. 
- Users will also be able to upload art inspired by the weekly prompt that can be viewed in a public gallery (if they'd like).
